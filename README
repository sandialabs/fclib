README for Feature Characterization Library (FCLib)

The Feature Characterization Library (FCLib) is a toolkit for creating and
applying feature characterizations to spatial-temporal datasets. Features are
coherent structures, often called regions of interest, that persist over time
in a dataset. Some examples of features include: vertex tubes in fluid
dynamical systems, failure zones in mechanical systems, and hot spots in
chemical systems. Feature characterization is the analysis of these features.

The FCLib manual (doxygen generated) may be found in the doc directory,
or can be built locally (see INSTALL). 

Or read INSTALL or doxyfiles/FCLib_installation.html for compiling and
installation instructions and RELEASE_NOTES or doxyfiles/FCLib_releaseNotest
for information about this release.

FCLib is a product of the FCDMF project (Feature Characterization using DMF)
which in turn is part of the ASCI Data Discovery project at Sandia National
Labs.


NOTE: FCLib has not been developed since 2008. This repository is here for
      historical documentation and is not actively maintained.

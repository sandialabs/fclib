 *
 * \modifications
 *    - Renata McCoy, created, developed with Doxygen v. 1.3.2 
 *    - 8/24/04 RM, added page for cvs conventions.
 *    - 9/1/04 WSK, moved pages to their own file.
 *    - 1/11/05 ACG, added new module TimeSeries
 *    - 6/1/05 ACG, TimeSeries changed to Series
 *    - 8/1/05 ACG, added ElemDeath
 *    - 12/19/05 ACG, added Shape
 *    - 12/19/05 ACG, previously added an example,
*       but hadnt added it here

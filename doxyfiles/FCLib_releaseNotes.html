<h4>Version 1.7.0 (current)</h4>

<p>
What's new:
<p>

<ul>
    <li> Subset module:
    <ul>
    <li> new Data Structure SeqSubset. SeqSubset is to Subset as SeqVariable is to Variable.
    A variety of new functions are provided for this. Note that Exodus does not support this
    construct and so seqSubsets
    are written out as normal subsets with a naming convention indication of sequence step.
    </ul>
    <li> Mesh module:
    <ul>
    <li> createSubsetMesh allows you to optionally copy only the geom, or combinations of
    types - var, seqvar, subset, seqsubset.
    <li> createSubsetMesh also writes out to the new mesh new variables FC_ELEMENTMAP and FC_VERTEXMAP
    which store the ids of the original mesh entities. These can be used for mapping items back to
    the original mesh later. Note that these are ints but exodus writes tehm out as doubles and they
    are read back in that way.
    <li> copyMesh allows you to optionally copy only the geom, or combinations of
     types - var, seqvar, subset, seqsubset.
    </ul>
    <li> Variable module:
    <ul>
    <li> copyVariableFromRegionMesh - copies a var from a smaller (region) mesh to a larger (orig) 
    one using the FC_ELEMENTMAP or FC_VERTEXMAP which store the ids of the orig mesh entities.
    Used for taking variables created on a mesh that was
    created via createSubsetMesh and putting them back on the original mesh. 
    <li> copyVariableToRegionMesh - copies a var from a larger mesh to a smaller one using the
    the FC_ELEMENTMAP or FC_VERTEXMAP which store the ids of the orig mesh entities. Used for
    taking variables on an original mesh and copying them to a mesh that was created
    via createSubsetMesh.
    <li> copySeqVariableStepFromRegionMesh - copies a var from a smaller (region) mesh to a 
    sequence step within a larger (orig) one using the FC_ELEMENTMAP or FC_VERTEXMAP which store the 
    ids of the orig mesh entities. Used for taking variables created on a mesh that was
    created via createSubsetMesh and putting them back on the original mesh into a particular sequence
    step. 
    </ul>
    <li> Exodusio module:
    <ul> 
    <li> Read in and write out of node, elem, and side sets. Empty sets of all type (node, element, side)
    are written to all meshes when they are read in.
    </ul>
    <li> Tools:
    <ul>
    <li> subsetter tool for subsetting on a variable with optional promotion to mesh. If promote to
    mesh, then can use upcoming reassembler tool to put things back on the original mesh. The subsetter
    and reassmbler tools were intended for determination of I/O savings for dumping (in situ) only
    the regions of interest of a simulation
    <li> regionreassmbler tool for reassembling vars on subsets promoted to meshes (created via
    the subsetter tool) back onto the original mesh. The subsetter and reassmbler tools were
    intended for determination of I/O savings for dumping (in situ) only
    the regions of interest of a simulation
    <li> skeleton tools for generating trees that represent the
	    structure of a mesh. These tools extract a spanning tree
	    representation of a mesh. Tree structures can then be
	    reduced in size and complexity through whittle tools.</li> 

    </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Deprecations:
<ul>
<li> copyMesh and createSubsetMesh API's have changed as above
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Bug Fixes:
</p>

<ul>
   <li> Exodus 4.61 had problems with supporting nodal subsets under some conditions.
        Exodus 4.71 or later is required 
   <li> Read in and write out empty node, side, and element sets in Exodus.
</ul>

<p>
Known Issues:

<ul>
</ul>
</p>
    


<a name="previous"><h3><hr>Previous Releases<hr></h3></a>


<h4>Version 1.6.1 (10/31/2007)</h4>

<p>
What's new:
<p>

<ul>
    <li> Exodusio module:
    <ul>
        <li> Reads in and writes out element and nodal attributes. These are FCLib's
	     non-seq vars.</li> 
        <li> Reads in and writes out element sets.</li>
        <li> These changes require Exodus 4.61 or later.
    </ul>
    <li> Variable module:
    <ul>
        <li>Handling conversion of Exodus non-component vars into component
	    vars on-demand only. New functions fc_getOrGenerate(Seq)VariableByName 
            will do this automatically for seq/non-seq vars. New auxiliary
            (or non-automatic) functions fc_get(seq)VariablesByName will
            obtain the component variables. Does not handle global yet.
            Currently this only supports x,y,z options and not
	    tensor component options. </li>
        <li>Mesh variables can now be converted from one association type to
	    another through copy(Seq)VariableWithNewAssociation(). These
	    conversion functions take a simple average of neighboring data
	    values in a source variable to build each value of the
	    destination variable. This averaging is particularly useful when
	    the user needs to plot smooth data represented by vertex values,
	    but only has data values at the elements.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Varmath module:
    <ul>
       <li> Added four new functions to fill in missing
            operations involving constants and sequence constants.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Tools:
     <ul>
       <li>fcdump now supports various command line filters that
	    enable users to search for specific objects within a file.</li>
       <li>New Tool "fcswapAssociation" can be used to convert Element variables
           to Vertex variables and vice versa.</li>
       <li>varNormalize will calculate and normalize the von mises stress
           and pressure, using the stress component variables, if the
	   von mises stress and pressure do not exist in the dataset.</li>
       <li>maxStress will also output the per step value normalized to the max
           for that mesh.</li>
       <li>exodump handles nodal and elements attributes and elem sets.</li>
       <li>All tools except for fc2ensight automatically discover and convert both 
           seq and non-seq components to component vars. See new commands in variable.</li>
       <li>tools no longer support saf</li>
     </ul>
     <li> Misc:
       <ul>
       <li>CVS has been replaced with SVN</li>
       <li>fc_printXXX functions for data structures now have option to print
           out in exponential notation with 5 digits of precision.</li>
       <li>Test suite now uses only exodus files, since SAF has been removed.</li>
       </ul>
     </li> 
</ul>

<p>
Deprecations:
</p>

<ul>
      <li> SAF (and HDF5) and SAF related tools and functionalities have been removed.</li>
      <li> fc_getSeqVariableByName now does not automatically combine component
           variables. See new functions in variable that replace this</li>
      <li> FClibGUI code and references have been removed as this part of the development
           has been sidelined.</li>
      <li> .names file support in Exodus has been removed.</li>	   
</ul>


<p>
Bug Fixes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> None </li>
</ul>

<p>
Known Issues:
</p>

<ul>
<li> fc2ensight has not been updated to utilize the new component variable functions. 
     This tool is no longer supported and may be removed since SAF has been removed.</li>
</ul>

<br>


<h4>Version 1.4.0 (10/20/06)</h4>

<p>
What's new:
<p>

<ul>
  <li> Global variables  are now supported by FCLib. Like mesh variables,
    global variables can be sequence or non-sequence variables. Global 
    variables have the association type FC_AT_WHOLE_DATASET and can be tested 
    for using fc_isVariableGlobal(). Most variable characterizations and 
    building blocks will work on global variables.
  </li>
  <li> Tools: 
    <ul>
      <li>New tool "fcinfo" can be used to get info about when and how
        (e.g. compile flags) the library was built.</li>
      <li>New tool "maxStress" reports stress in regions in tension
        and in compression.</li>
      <li> New tool "geomExtract" extracts the geometry of a single step
        of a dataset into a stateless Exodus file.</li>
      <li> New tool "tearCompare" uses output of two runs of "tears" to
        compare how the tears match up.
      <li> Tool "tears" now has optional flag to write out shape info and
        use that to classify tears (Break, Tunnel, Pit, etc).
      </li>
      <li>Tool "gaplines" now splits gaplines into sets based on the sides of
         the meshes involved.</li>
      <li>Tool "gaplines" can now drop lines attached to dead elements.</li>
      <li>Tool "fcconvert" can now convert to the same file type. This can be
         used to "FCLib-alize" datasets to FCLib's data model.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Storage module:
    <ul>
      <li> New capabilities for FC_SortedIntArray: get numValue and a copy of 
        the values, get front and back values, pop from front and back, 
        conversion  to other simple data objects.</li>
      <li> New simple data object: FC_SortedBlobArray. It's usage is 
        similar to FC_SortedIntArray but it manages pointers 
        to arbitrary data "blobs" instead of ints.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Varmath module:
    <ul>
      <li> New function to calculate Von Mises stress and 
            pressure from the symmetric stress tensor.</li>
      <li> Two "missing" functions added to cover all
            variable/sequence variable combinations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Shape module:
    <ul>
      <li> New function to get mean and std dev of the normals of the 
	    individual faces making up a side. </li>
      <li> New functions to convert a current shape into a new shape:
            1) based upon a different angle, and 2) reduce the number of 
            existing sides to a specified number.</li>
      <li> New clear function that deallocates a shape's memory, but keeps
            the subsets valid.</li>
      <li> New init function that blanks out a shape's fields without doing
             deallocation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> File IO:
    <ul>
      <li>The LSDyna Reader now supports beams (1D line elements) and shells
        (2D quad elements). </li>
      <li> Both the LSDyna Reader and the Exodus Reader/Writer have been 
        updated to use the new global variable interface.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Interface changes of special notice (you'll probably have to change your code):
</p>

<ul>
   <li> The arguments and behavior for all fc_getXByName() functions have 
     changed (where X refers to Dataset, Mesh, Subset, Sequence, and the
     variety of Variable types). Previously, they would return the first 
     matching item, or an error if there were no matching items. This was
     undesirable for two reasons: 1) you could never get a handle to a second
     object if it existed, and 2) not finding an object of the specified name
     is not always considered an error. Now the functions return the number of
     matching items and an array of those items, which can be empty.</li>
   <li>FC_AT_WHOLE has been split into FC_AT_WHOLE_MESH and
     FC_AT_WHOLE_DATASET. You should be able to safely replace with
     FC_AT_WHOLE_MESH, but in some cases of WHOLE you may rather 
     be using the new global variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Deprecations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Linked lists have gone away in favor of new sorted int and blob arrays.
  </li> 
  <li> Shape:
    <ul>
      <li> All screw specific subset and mesh building functions have been 
        removed, with the exception of fc_createScrewOrder. The user will have
        to reproduce the screw shape building by explicitly creating the
        order and calling reorder shape, akin to how all other reorderings
        are done.</li>
      <li> fc_createThinShapeOrder has been replaced by 
        fc_createLargeAndOpposingSidesOrder and 
        fc_createLargeAndNonAdjacentSidesOrder.</li>
      <li> fc_projectedSubsetElementBoundingBoxIntersection has dropped
        the mesh from the argument list.</li>
      <li> fc_createAscendingAreaOrder has been replaced
        by fc_createDescendingAreaOrder</li>
      <li> getPlanarSideNormal now takes the shape and side ID as 
        arguments, rather than the side subsets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</p>
Bug Fixes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Tool "dyna2names.pl" no longer has problems reading single character
    names.</li>
  <li> LSDyna reader can now handle d3plot plot files that have gaps in
    the numbering (e.g. d3plot, d3plot02, d3plot04 ...). </li>
  <li> Fixed bug in floating point comparisons that caused divide by zero
    if one argument was zero and the other was negative.</li>
  <li> Fixed bug in fc_isSubsetSuperset that returned a positive result
    if the potential superset has more total values than the potential
    subset has and all of which are less than those in the potential subset
  </li>
  <li> Improved subset names for the shapes returned by multi-shape
    creating methods, such as fc_getSubsetShapes and fc_getMeshShapes.
    Now subsets are named relative to the shape they are in, rather than
    apparently randomly.</li>
  <li> Tool "gaplines" now exits gracefully if no gaplines are found.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h4>Version 1.3.0 (07/25/06)</h4>

<p>
What's new:
<p>

<ul>
  <li> Tools: 
    <ul>
      <li> New tool "screwBreaks" reports when screws break, and calculates
           estimate of how close screws are to breaking by projecting
           dead elments to the cross-section. </li>
      <li> New tool "gaplines" creates a mesh of zero length lines between
           two meshes at time zero, and then reports the statistics of
           the length of the lines over time (gapping will cause lines to
           become nonzero in length). Also creates an output file for
           visualization of the gap lines.</li>
      <li> New tool "extents" reports bounding boxes of the meshes and 
           the dataset. </li>
      <li> New tool "fcconvert" can convert between different dataset file
           formats. "fc2exo" is a wrapper that creates an ExodusII file. 
           </li>
      <li> Improved tool "tears". Can now: combine tears across meshes based
           on proximity; request analysis of a specified timestep instead of
           just the last timespet; request analysis of only specified meshes;
           provide multiple "death" criteria; request damage-weighted volumes;
           and reports overall summary at end of output.</li>
      <li> All tools now support the -d displacement flag if appropriate.
           Underlying routines from gome module now have displaced versions. 
           </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>  New and improved building blocks:
    <ul>
      <li> New data type "Sorted Int Array" in SimpleDataTypes module. Can be
           used to maintain a unique list of integers, is 
           self-expanding, and has O(nlog(n)) lookup time.</li>
      <li> Shape module revamped. It now uses a struct, FC_Shape, to hold all
           shape information. There are also major performances increases
           and an interface cleanup (see deprecations below for some function
	    name changes). </li>
      <li> Element death module revamped. Some functions split into two
           separate ones. Interfaces changed to use new FC_Shape struct. 
      <li> Proximity methods added to Geometry module.</li>
      <li> Some methods in Geometry module have been expanded to operate on 
           arrays of meshes or subset. </li>
      <li> Added function fc_calcSquaredEuclideanDistance() for performance
           coding (can save a sqrt operation). </li>
      <li> Added convenience function fc_getSequenceCoordsAsDataType() to 
           fetch sequence data as requested type </li>
      <li> New functions fc_doSubsetsIntersect() and fc_isSubsetSuperSet() 
           </li>
      <li> Set of functions added to util module to do dbl or flt "significant 
           digit" aware comparisons like "==" and ">". </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>  File IO:
    <ul>
      <li> Dataset's names and their filenames are now two separate entities.
           (Used to use dataset filename as the name, now use description
           within file if it exists.) </li>
      <li> Added .names file support to LSDyna reader. Tool dyna2names can be
           used to create a names file from an LSDyna input file (.k file). 
           </li>
      <li> New function fc_rewriteDataset() can write a dataset already 
           linked to a file to a new file; it is no longer necessary to copy 
           a dataset before writing. </li>
      <li> XML parsing is available via libxml2. </li>
      <li> Bounding Box file format (for ParaView Lookmark importing) has 
           been changed to an xml file. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</p>
Bug Fixes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> File IO module:
    <ul>
      <li> The LS-Dyna reader now starts generically named variables with
           '1' instead of '0' to better agree with other tools (e.g.
	   'elem_var_0' is now 'elem_var_1').</li>
      <li> LSDyna reader can now handle datasets where there is only 1
           global variable. </li>
      <li> LSDyna reader can now handle datasets where the element data
           for a single mesh is not all in 1 consecutive block. </li>
      <li> Mesh IDs from some file formats (Exodus LSDyna) are saved and
           reused when rewriting a dataset. </li>
      <li> The Exodus reader is currently hacked. Currently vector variables 
           are read in a separate components. When fc_getSeqVariableByName() 
           is called, the reader will stitch the components together and hand 
           a vector variable back. Someday the Exodus reader will read in
           the variables as vectors at the beginning. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Geom module:
    <ul>
      <li> Fixed roundoff error in _fc_calcTriArea() by switching algorithms 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Shape module:
    <ul>
      <li> Fix in fc_createSideAdjacencyMatrix. This affects other calls
           in the Shape Module as well as the ElementDeath example. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Deprecations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Geom module:
    <ul>
      <li> fc_projectedElementBoundingBoxIntersection now takes
           the projection normal as FC_Coords rather than FC_Vector
      <li> fc_projectedSubsetElementBoundingBoxIntersection now takes
           the projection normal as FC_Coords rather than FC_Vector
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Shape module:
    <ul>
      <li> fc_createSideAdjacencyMatrix has been replaced by a method
           of the same name, but different signature.
      <li> fc_getSubsetSides has been replaced by fc_getSubsetShapes.
      <li> fc_getMeshSides has been replaced by fc_getMeshShapes.
      <li> fc_calcDistanceMatrix has changed representation for
           infinite distance items to -1.
     </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.2.0 (01/25/06)</h4>

<p>
What's new:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> File IO changes: not just SAF anymore!
     <ul>
        <li> Reads and writes Exodus II data files. </li>
        <li> Reads LSDyna data files. </li>
        <li> File type is automatically detected during read, or can be
             specified. </li>
        <li> FCLib can be built without SAF or Exodus II support, but
             testing cannot be done without SAF. </li>
        <li> Upgraded to SAF 2.0.2 and HDF5 1.7.45. **NOTE this version of SAF 
             depends on a developmental version of HDF5 and may not work for
             any other version. </li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li> API changes:
     <ul>
        <li> SAF specific tools (except safdump) are now fc general tools and
             their names are prefixed with 'fc' instead of 'saf' (e.g. 
             saf2ensight is now fc2ensight and works on all file types readable
             by FCLib). </li>
        <li> fc_getNumMeshEntity() has been changed to fc_getMeshNumEntity() to
             follow the general API naming conventions. </li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li> More characterization building blocks, including:
     <ul>
        <li> Separate deformation out from the displacement variable. </li>
        <li> Get the diameter of a subset. </li>
	<li> New module 'series' for sequence-based analysis routines. Also
	     additions to the 'sequence' module to work with the 'series'
	     module. </li>
	<li> Math of sequence variables.
        <li> New module 'elemdeath' for dead regions of elements. Also
	     additions to other modules to work with the 'elemdeath' module.
	     These include methods enabling characterization of the shape of
	     the dead region and comparison of it to the live region by such
	     things as determination of the intersection of dead region with
	     the original mesh
             sides and projection of the dead region onto a live a region.
	     These additional methods can be found in the 'geom' and 'topo'
	     modules, and the new 'shape' module below. </li>
        <li> New module 'shape' for determining information about shapes. Mainly
	     intended to work with elemdeath module. e.g., given particular
	     characteristics of the shape of a mesh, are there particular things
	     about the dead element region that are of interest ? </li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li> GUI moved to separate package. </li>
  <li> Library compiles under 64 bit linux. </li>
  <li> Changed internal mesh struts to reduce memory usage (by 85% for the
       tears tool). Did this by making auxilliary information like edges/face,
       neighbors, etc. build lazily and independent of each other. </li>
  <li> Some performance issues addressed when there are really large
       numbers of variables. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0.0 (01/04/05)</h4>

<p>
No major changes, just final tuning for release.  This version has been
spell-checked, memory-checked and memory-leak-checked. Coverage test also
indicated that 84% of the library is being tested by the unit and regressions
tests. 
</p>

<br>

<h4>Version 0.9.0 (12/12/04)</h4>

<p>
The Data API is settling down and new characterization building blocks have
been added.
</p>

<p>
What's new:
</p>

<ul>
   <li> More introductory documentation available on main Doxygen page. </li>
   <li> API changes:
      <ul>
         <li> Names of big data routines that return pointers that callers 
              should NOT release are post-fixed with 'Ptr'.</li>
         <li> Tidied up Feature & Feature Tracking interface. </li>
         <li> Tidied up Varmath interface. </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li> More characterizations building blocks, including:
      <ul>
         <li> Displaced mesh versions of geometric routines. </li>
         <li> More bounding box support (check intersect, displaced and
              subset version). </li>
         <li> Subset versions of statistics routines. </li>
         <li> Slice variable data by location in addition to time
              (i.e. can get point history). </li>
         <li> Get skin routines. </li>
         <li> Get edge lengths/face areas/region volumes. </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Now fully supports edges & faces. </li>
   <li> Prototype SWIG interface in interfaces. </li>
   <li> Prototype GUI in interfaces/java. </li>
   <li> Reasonably complete testing (unit + regression tests = ~82% 
        coverage). </li>
</ul>
    
<br>

<h4>Version 0.9.0-dev (9/04)</h4>

<p>
This is not an official release--it is being used to test documentation 
and creation of FCLib web pages on the FCDMF web site.
</p>

<br>
    
<h4>Version 0.8.0 (8/10/04)</h4>

<p>
Data structures finished & release mechanism in place.
</p>

<a name="Platform"><h4>1. Platforms </h4></a>  

<p>
FCLib was developed using gcc and gmake on Linux RedHat 7.3, RedHat Enterprise
3.0, RedHat Fedora 7, and Mac OS X. It should work on any Unix platform and most places with gcc
and gmake installations. It will probably work with most C compilers.
</p>

<a name="Downloads"><h4>2. Downloads</h4></a>

<p>

The code is available for download from our web page 
<a target="_top" href="http://fclib.ca.sandia.gov">
http://fclib.ca.sandia.gov</a>. 
Some of the optional libraries are available there as well.

</p>
 
<a name="Dependencies"><h4>3. Dependencies </h4></a>  

<p>
There are no required dependencies for FCLib. Optional dependencies include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>File IO w/ ExodusII -- Requires ExodusII 4.61 or greater and NetCDF 3.6.2 
      or greater -- ExodusII is a file format library developed by 
      Sandia National Labs and is available (bundled with NetCDF) at our
      web site <a targe="_top" href="http://fclib.ca.sandia.gov"
      >http://fclib.ca.sandia.gov</a>.
  </li>
  <li>File IO w/ Gnome libxml2 -- This XML file format library is found on
      most Unix systems in /usr. Otherwise it is available at <a target="_top"
      href="http://xmlsoft.org/">http://xmlsoft.org</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Building Documentation -- Requires Doxygen 1.4 or greater (and
      optionally Graphviz with gd support) --
      Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, and a variety of
      other languages. It can be obtained at <a target="_top"
      href=http://www.doxygen.org>http://www.doxygen.org</a>. If
	you are installing this on a Fedora Linux machine these
	dependencies can be resolved with:<br><br>
	<b>yum install gd graphviz graphviz-gd doxygen</b> 

  </li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>
NOTE: SAF file i/o has been phased out in this release.
</p>


<a name="Configuring"><h4>4. Configuring</h4></a>    

<p>    
You must manually configure FCLib. Edit the file "Makefile.include" to reflect 
your system (more instructions can be found within that file):
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      For Exodus File IO --  On by default (to turn off set HAVE_EXODUS to no).
      Provide the location of the include and library directories for Exodus II
      and NetCDF.
   </li>
   <li>
      For XML File IO -- On by default (to turn off set HAVE_LIBXML2 to no).
      Provide the location of of the libxml2 helper program xml2-config.
   </li>
   <li>
      To install outside of build directory -- Provide an absolute path to
      the install directory (include files will be placed in 
      INSTALL_DIR/include, library files in INSTALL_DIR/lib, and tool
      executables in INSTALL_DIR/bin).
   </li>
   <li>
      You can also change the compiler and compiler flags, but the code has 
      only been tested with gcc and the listed flags.  
   </li>
</ul> 		
   
<a name="Build"><h4>5. Building</h4></a>

<p>
Below is a list of make targets. The typical build process is "make", then
"make check", then "make install".
</p>

<p> Additional testing requires that fclib-data (a repository of large and real
data examples) be present in the same directory that the fclib build
directory is in (or edit Makefile.include to point to it).

<ol>
   <li>
      When making the documentation, if you get errors about building 
      dependency graphs, you will need to also install Graphviz 
      (<a target="_top" 
      href=http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/>http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/</a>).
      <p></p>
   </li>
 
   <li>When making the documentation, if you see errors about Graphviz
     or <b>dot</b> not being able to generate GIF output files, you'll
     need to install additional Graphviz support libraries. Different
     versions of Graphviz support different image formats (due to
	license fears). One option for fixing this problem is to
	install the  
	<a href=http://www.boutell.com/gd/>GD</a> library extension
	for Graphviz. 
      <p></p>
   </li>
   <li>
      Most warnings during 'make doc' can be safely ignored. Warnings of the
      type "Warning: ignoring unsupported tag ..." may occur if you are 
      using an older version of Doxygen.

     <p></p>
    </li>
   <li>
      If compiling fails with the error "Internal compiler error in 
      dwarf2out_finish, at dwarf2out.c:12301", we believe this is a compiler
      bug. It can be "fixed" by removing '-g' from the CXXFLAG variable in 
      Makefile.include, or by trying a different compiler. We have only seen 
      the error once--with gcc 3.2.2 built for Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5.
      <p></p>
   </li>
   <li>
      If linking fails with errors having to do with "ssaio" or "aio_...",
      try adding "-lrt" to the variable HDF5_LIBS in Makefile.include.
      (This should be happening automatically for linux machines).
      <p></p>
   </li>
</ol>

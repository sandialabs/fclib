  6. Troubleshooting


1. Platforms

FCLib was developed using gcc and gmake on Linux RedHat 7.3, RedHat Enterprise
3.0, RedHat Fedora 7, and Mac OS X. It should work on any Unix platform and
most places with gcc and gmake installations. It will probably work with most C
compilers.

2. Downloads

The code is available for download from our web page http://
fclib.ca.sandia.gov. Some of the optional libraries are available there as
well.

3. Dependencies

There are no required dependencies for FCLib. Optional dependencies include:

* File IO w/ ExodusII -- Requires ExodusII 4.71 or greater and NetCDF 3.6.2 or
  greater -- ExodusII is a file format library developed by Sandia National
  Labs and is available (bundled with NetCDF) at our web site http://
  fclib.ca.sandia.gov.
* File IO w/ Gnome libxml2 -- This XML file format library is found on most
  Unix systems in /usr. Otherwise it is available at http://xmlsoft.org.
* Building Documentation -- Requires Doxygen 1.4 or greater (and optionally
  Graphviz with gd support) -- Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C,
  Java, and a variety of other languages. It can be obtained at http://
  www.doxygen.org. If you are installing this on a Fedora Linux machine these
  dependencies can be resolved with:

  yum install gd graphviz graphviz-gd doxygen


NOTE: SAF file i/o has been phased out in this release.

4. Configuring

You must manually configure FCLib. Edit the file "Makefile.include" to reflect
your system (more instructions can be found within that file):

* For Exodus File IO -- On by default (to turn off set HAVE_EXODUS to no).
  Provide the location of the include and library directories for Exodus II and
  NetCDF.
* For XML File IO -- On by default (to turn off set HAVE_LIBXML2 to no).
  Provide the location of of the libxml2 helper program xml2-config.
* To install outside of build directory -- Provide an absolute path to the
  install directory (include files will be placed in INSTALL_DIR/include,
  library files in INSTALL_DIR/lib, and tool executables in INSTALL_DIR/bin).
* You can also change the compiler and compiler flags, but the code has only
  been tested with gcc and the listed flags.


5. Building

Below is a list of make targets. The typical build process is "make", then
"make check", then "make install".

make                 - Build the library and tools.
make install         - Install the library and tools in the directory specified
                       in Makefile.include.
make doc             - Create Doxygen generated html documentation.
make data            - Build data files for testing and examples.
make examples        - Builds examples.
make regtest         - Build and run the regression tests (if no make errors
                       are reported, the regression tests passed).
make check           - Build and run the unit tests.
make world           - Builds everything and then runs the regression and unit
                       tests.
make distclean       - Deletes files created by the build process (use if you
                       want to rebuild from scratch).
make reallydistclean - Deletes all generated files including some of the
                       documentation as well as the files deleted by 'make
                       distclean'.

Additional testing requires that fclib-data (a repository of large and real
data examples) be present in the same directory that the fclib build directory
is in (or edit Makefile.include to point to it).

make regtest2 - Build and run additional regression test. Only works if you
                have fclib-data.
make check2   - Build and run additional unit tests. Only works if you have
                fclib-data.

Troubleshooting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you problem is not addressed by one of the items below, please contact as at
fclib-help@ca.sandia.gov.

  1. When making the documentation, if you get errors about building dependency
     graphs, you will need to also install Graphviz (http://
     www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/).
  2. When making the documentation, if you see errors about Graphviz or dot not
     being able to generate GIF output files, you'll need to install additional
     Graphviz support libraries. Different versions of Graphviz support
     different image formats (due to license fears). One option for fixing this
     problem is to install the GD library extension for Graphviz.
  3. Most warnings during 'make doc' can be safely ignored. Warnings of the
     type "Warning: ignoring unsupported tag ..." may occur if you are using an
     older version of Doxygen.
  4. If compiling fails with the error "Internal compiler error in
     dwarf2out_finish, at dwarf2out.c:12301", we believe this is a compiler
     bug. It can be "fixed" by removing '-g' from the CXXFLAG variable in
     Makefile.include, or by trying a different compiler. We have only seen the
     error once--with gcc 3.2.2 built for Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5.
  5. If linking fails with errors having to do with "ssaio" or "aio_...", try
     adding "-lrt" to the variable HDF5_LIBS in Makefile.include. (This should
     be happening automatically for linux machines).

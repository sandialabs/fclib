  This document outlines our conventions for using 
  <a href=http://subversion.tigris.org/>Subversion (SVN)</a>
  to manage the
  development and release of FCLib.

  <h3> <hr> <a name="mini-svn">1. Mini SVN Review</a> <hr> </h3>
  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->

    <p>Here we review some concepts of general SVN usage here before getting into
      the FCLib specific conventions. SVN is a revision control system
      that provides features similar to CVS. In 2007 we switched from CVS
      to SVN because SVN (1) provides url-based access to the repo, (2)
      uses a database backend for managing files, and (3) separates meta
      data about the repo from the files in the repo (for more
      information, consult your 
      <a href=http://subversion.tigris.org/>Subversion (SVN)</a>
      documentation).</P>

    <p>While everything is just a "file in a directory somewhere in the
      repo" in SVN, it is helpful to create snapshots of the project
      at different points in time. We follow the standard directory
      convention for managing a subversion repository:</p>
    
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <b>Trunk</b>
       <dd>
         The main development of the project (e.g., the most recent
         work) takes place in the trunk. 
       </dd>
    </dt>

    <dt>
      <b>Branch</b>
       <dd>
         Periodically there is a need to branch off from the trunk to
         explore whether a new, significant feature will be
	 worthwhile. Experimental code branches are created in the 
         branches subdirectory of a project.
       </dd>
    </dt>

    <dt>
      <b>Tags</b>
       <dd>
         At major points in a design's lifetime, it is useful to take
         a snapshot of the design and tag it for internal/external
 	 release. The tags subdirectory of a project contains these
         snapshots. In general, we treat tagged directories as frozen
         designs and do not edit them.
        </dd>
    </dt>

  <h3> <hr> <a name="release">2. Release Numbers</a><hr> </h3>
  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->
  <p>Historically, FCLib releases have been labeled using a standard
  3-part numbering system. Releases are listed as fclib-x.y.z,
  where x, y, and z are the major, minor, and version numbers.
  Updates are cumulative so that v1.0.3 will also have updates from 
  v1.0.1 and v1.0.2. Revision numbers used to be tied closely to
  branches in the repository when we used CVS. However, we relaxed
  this constraint when we switched to SVN (due to SVN's built-in
  revision IDs). We now update the release numbers when create a
  new tag in the repo.</p>

  <h3> <hr> <a name="releaseMechanics">3. Release Mechanics</a> <hr> </h3>
  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->

  Please also read the release instructions in the 
  <a href="releaseHowTo_page.html">Release "How To"</a> page
  listed on related pages in the FCLib Manual. They explain how to update
  the release notes at the same time.

  <p>The specific procedure for generating a release is (commands apply to entire repository):

  <p>
  <ol>
  <li>Make sure you are ready for a release:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Verify that you have the exact snapshot that you want to release 
	in your working directory and that it has been committed. (Don't 
	forget to make sure that all tests are passing.)
      </li>
      <li>
	Update FCLib_releaseNotes.html and commit.
      </li>
      <li>
	Remove '-dev' from the version number in Makefile.include and
	commit.
      </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  <li>Copy the trunk to the tag directory with the new release
	number<br>
  <pre>
svn copy http://path/to/repo/fclib/trunk http://path/to/repo/fclib/tags/release-1.1.1
svn commit
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Update the Trunk's version number in Makefile.include and commit.</li>
  </ol>

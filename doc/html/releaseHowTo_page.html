    <title>FCLib Release How To</title>
  </head>

  <body bgcolor="#ffffff" vlink="#0000ff" alink="#0000ff">
   
  This document contains step-by-step instructions for doing a code release.
 
  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->
  <h3> <hr> <a name="finishing-code">0. Finish coding changes</a> <hr> </h3>
  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->

  <ul>
    <li> Make sure tests all run -- including regtest2 and checkall2 
         which depend on outside data. </li>
    <li> Memory & leak check with valgrind. </li>
    <li> A good idea to do some coverage testing. See instructions in
         comments in the script util/analyze_gcov.pl. </li>
    <li> Also a good idea to made sure everything is working on multiple
         platforms types. </li>
    <li> Update documentation -- especially FCLib_releaseNotes.html. Note
         that entries the current developoment version will become the
         entries for the current release. </li>
  </ul>

  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->
  <h3> <hr> <a name="release-check">1. Make sure 'make release' works</a> <hr> </h3>
  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->

  Make sure that 'make release' works by doing it and then checking the
  tarball that is created for:

  <ul>
    <li> Doxgyen documentation gets made. </li>
    <li> Generated text files (INSTALL & RELEASE_NOTES) get made. </li>
    <li> Make sure everything makes and all tests pass. </li>
    <li> Make sure all auxilliary files are present. </li>
  </ul>

  Note that errors are usually due to errors in the "release" targets of the 
  Makefiles.

  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->
  <h3> <hr> <a name="check-out">2. Double check that everything is checked in</a>
  <hr> </h3>
  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->

  <ul>
    <li>Check in all fixes from 0. and 1. above. </li>
    <li>do <tt>svn update</tt> - shouldn't see much. </li>
  </ul>

  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->
  <h3> <hr> <a name="DoRelease">3. Do a Release (a regular one, see #4 for an
  update/bug fix release)</a> <hr> </h3>
  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->
  For releases we need to update the version number in
    Makefile.include and FCLib_releaseNotes.html, use the Makefile to
    build a tar file, and then create a tag in the svn repo. For more
    details on what is going on with the svn commands, see the 
  <a href="repo_page.html#release">Repo Conventions</a> page in the 
  FCLib manual (under Related Pages). 

  <P>For this example, assume that the current version number in 
  Makefile.include is "<tt>FC_VERSION = fclib-1.4.0-dev</tt>".

  <ol>
    <li> Set up the release by removing '-dev' from the version number:
<pre>  edit Makefile.include: change FC_VERSION to fclib-1.4.0
  edit doxyfiles/FCLib_releaseNotes: change current version to fclib-1.4.0
      and add date for the release.
  commit Makefile.include doxyfiles/FCLib_releaseNotes.html
  svn commit
</pre>
   </li> 
      <li>
	Make a tag in the repo by copying the trunk to the tags
	directory:
<pre>
svn copy http://path/to/repo/fclib/trunk http://path/to/repo/fclib/tags/release-1.4.0
svn commit
</pre>
      </li>


   <li>      
     Set up an trunk for future updates/bug fixes by incrementing
     the update number and adding '-dev' back on:
<pre>  
  edit Makefile.include: 
      change FC_Version to fclib-1.4.1-dev
  edit doxyfiles/FCLib_releaseNotes:
      move section for 1.4.0 to 'Previous Releases'
      make new section for 1.4.1-dev in 'Latest Release'
  commit Makefile.include doxyfiles/FCLib_releaseNotes.html
</pre>
     <p></p>
   </li> 

  </ol>

    At the end of this process, you will be able to retrieve older
    releases by checking out the corresponding directory from the
    <b>tags</b> directory, and the current development branch from the
    <b>trunk</b> directory.

 
  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->
  <h3> <hr> <a name="updates">4. Do an Update/Bug Fix Release</a> <hr> </h3>
  <!--  ------------------------------------------------  -->

    The process for doing an update/bug fix release is the same as the
    above, except for the release numbers. Prior to using SVN, it was
    necessary to do more explicit tag management via cvs.

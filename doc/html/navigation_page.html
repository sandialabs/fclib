About Doxygen</a></h2>
This manual was generated using <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html>">Doxygen</a> which automates creating documentation from the source code and special comments inserted in the code. Because the documentation is spatially co-located with the objects it is documenting, it tends to be more up-to-date. Unfortunately for new users, this mode of documentation tends to favor reference documentation with detailed documentation on each function or data structure--if you don't already know what you are looking for, it can be quite hard to find. Here we will give information that will hopefully let you navigate the documentation better and point to the places that are best for learning higher level information.<h2><a class="anchor" name="DoxygenGuide">
General Doxygen Navigation</a></h2>
Almost everything in the Doxygen documentation is linked to more documentation. Even the functions and variables in code snippets are linked to their documentation. Sometimes you may have to follow a few links to get to the information that you want (this may be a side effect of Doxygen being designed for C++ and the library only being in C).<h3><a class="anchor" name="HeaderSideBar">
Header and Side Bar</a></h3>
The header is the purple band that you will find at the top of every page in this manual. The side bar is a separate frame at the left hand side of the window showing a list of document and book icons. The header and the side bar give you access to the same information, but in a slightly different way. The advantage of the side-bar is that you can view hierarchical organizations (see <a class="el" href="navigation_page.html#MoreSideBar">More about the Side Bar</a> below).<p>
Below is a summary of the categories in the header. The most important one for learning about the library is <em>Modules</em> because it will allow you to navigate the documentation by subject. This will be the main subject of section <a class="el" href="navigation_page.html#FCLibNavigation">FCLib Specific Doxygen Navigation</a> below.<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td>Main Page </td><td>(Or "Feature Characterization Library" in the side bar) Will take you to the main page of the manual.   </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Modules</b> </td><td><b>FCLib's organization of of the documentation by subject.</b>  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Data Structures </td><td>(Also "Alphabetical List" in the header) List of the data structures.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Data Fields </td><td>List of data fields (e.g. struct members).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Globals </td><td>List of everything except data structures and data fields (e.g. variables, functions, enum values, etc.).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>File List </td><td>List of all of the source files.  </td></tr>

<h3><a class="anchor" name="MoreSideBar">
More about the Side Bar</a></h3>
The side bar shows the manual documentation in a hierarchical view. The top level of the hierarchy is the same categories that are in the header. Clicking the <em>name</em> of a page or book icon in the side bar will bring up the documentation for that entity in the main part of the window. Clicking the book icon itself, or the little box to the left of it, will expand the view of the entities contained within that icon. Clicking a document icon does nothing--you need to click the name.<h2><a class="anchor" name="FCLibNavigation">
FCLib Specific Doxygen Navigation</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="DoxygenModules">
Modules</a></h3>
For the Doxygen documentation, a <em>module</em> is a means of collecting related documentation into a single page and modules can be nested. FCLib also uses the term module to refer to related groupings of functions that are usually in the same file; there is a close, but not strict, correspondence between FCLib code modules and our Doxygen modules.<p>
We will use the side bar to walk through the organization of the FCLib's module documentation because you will be able to see the organization while staying on this page. However, we do not recommend using the side bar for exploring the documentation as there is more information if you go to the pages directly.<p>
Clicking "Modules" will take you to the top level Modules page where you can see the entire module hierarchy. Clicking any module will take you to a page for the module where you can see the documentation for the module, links to modules within that module, and the documentation for data structures and routines. Child modules will also have a link back to their parent module.<h3><a class="anchor" name="TopLevelModules">
Top Level Modules</a></h3>
If you click the book icon named "Modules" it will expand to show you the top level organization of the library:<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td><a class="el" href="group__API.html">FCLib API</a> </td><td>Data structures and routines for building feature characterizations.   </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a class="el" href="group__Tools.html">Command line tools</a> </td><td>Helper tools and a few pre-built feature characterization applications.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a class="el" href="group__Examples.html">Examples</a> </td><td>Example codes showing library usage.  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Now click the book icons next to "Command line tools" and "Examples" to open them. These two modules contain a module for each tool and example. If you click text "Command line tools", you will get a page that lists the same tools you see in the side bar, and a brief explanation for each.<h3><a class="anchor" name="APIModules">
API Modules</a></h3>
The FCLib API is the core of the library and its modules are more deeply nested than either the tools or the examples. If you click the book icon next to "FCLib API" you will see a list of top level modules in the API. These modules can be categorized roughly as:<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td>Data Manipulation </td><td><a class="el" href="group__DataTypes.html">Data Types</a>, <a class="el" href="group__SimpleDataObjects.html">Simple Data Objects</a>, <a class="el" href="group__DataInterface.html">Data Interface</a>   </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Support </td><td><a class="el" href="group__Utilities.html">Utilities</a>, <a class="el" href="group__ErrorHandling.html">Error Handling</a>  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Characterizations and Building Blocks </td><td><a class="el" href="group__GeometricRelations.html">Geometric Relations</a>, <a class="el" href="group__TopologyRelations.html">Topological Relations</a>, <a class="el" href="group__VariableMath.html">Variable Math</a>, <a class="el" href="group__Statistics.html">Statistics Routines</a>, <a class="el" href="group__Threshold.html">Threshold</a>, <a class="el" href="group__Features.html">Features</a>, <a class="el" href="group__FeatureTracking.html">Feature Tracking</a>, and more ... </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Developer sandbox (play area) </td><td><a class="el" href="group__Custom.html">Custom</a>  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
For more details, go the the page for the <a class="el" href="group__API.html">FCLib API</a> module which will give a description for each of these modules. We recommend starting with <a class="el" href="group__DataInterface.html">Data Interface</a>. Some of the child modules are labeled ("Private") which means that we think the contents are not interesting to the general user.<p>
Have fun!<h3><a class="anchor" name="ModulesAndSideBar">
(Aside: Modules and the Side Bar)</a></h3>
Unlike the Modules page, which shows the hierarchical organization of only the modules, the side bar list goes to all the way down to individual data structures and functions. If you open the module <em>Simple Data Types</em> within <em>FCLib API</em> you will see book icons for <em>Typedefs</em>, <em>Enumerations</em>, and <em>Functions</em>--these are Doxygen's syntactic breakdown of the data structures and routines found within that module (other possible categories are <em>Data Structures</em>, <em>Defines</em>, and <em>Variables</em>). If you open these you will see the specific typedefs, enumerations, and functions within the module. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Wed Oct 31 11:10:00 2007 for FCLib by&nbsp;

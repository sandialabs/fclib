<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>
One very common strategy for doing data analysis in spatial-temporal datasets
is to focus in on regions of the dataset where interesting things are
happening. If we define a feature as a coherent region that persists over time,
this data analysis strategy becomes <em>feature-based data analysis</em>. The
entire process of finding features, analyzing features, and using the results
is called <em>feature characterization</em>.
</p>

<p> Although feature-based data analysis is common, the feature
characterization process is not very well supported. Most users manually
identify and analyze features, a process which is tedious and prone to
errors. And when tools are created, they are usually one-off solutions that are
difficult to reapply to new problems.

<p>
The goal of the <a target="_top" href=http://www.ca.sandia.gov/fcdmf>Feature
Characterization project (FCDMF) </a> is to provide general resources for 
the creation and use of feature characterizations. Our first product is the
Feature Characterization Library (FCLib) which is a toolkit for creating 
characterizations and characterization applications. The philosophy of
FCLib is to automate as much of the tedious parts of doing characterizations
as possible, while remaining flexible enough to create a wide range of
characterizations. 
</p>
    
<a name="highlights"><h3> Features (ha, ha) of the FCLib library: </h3></a>

<p>
FCLib consists of a library of routines and a few command-line tools.
The library routines can be roughly divided into the following categories:
</p>

<ul>
   <li> <em>data manipulation</em> - e.g. access to mesh coordinates and
        variable data. </li>
   <li> <em>feature processing</em> - e.g. creating and tracking 
        features. </li>
   <li> <em>characterization building blocks </em> - e.g. finding an element's
        neighbors or calculating its volume. </li>
   <li> <em>characterizations</em> - e.g. determine minimum and maximum values
        of a variable in a feature. </li>
</ul>

<p>
The categories necessarily overlap categories as one analyst's characterization
will be another analyst's building block. The command-line tools include a few
examples of generic and custom characterization applications built with FCLib.
</p>

<p>
The biggest feature of the library is that it is built to be <em>feature
aware</em>--that is, to understand and operate on features. Another important
feature of the library is its simplified interface. The API was written to
support multiple levels of users--from those who will use the built-in
"check-box" characterizations (so called because there will eventually be a GUI
that allows users to "check" the characterizations that they want) to more
advanced users who wish to build their own characterizations.
</p> 

<p>
FCLib is coded in C and operates on unstructured mesh data.
</p>

<a name="characterizations"><h3>Characterizations and Building Blocks</h3></a>

<p>
This is a sampling of some of the generic characterizations and
characterization building blocks that are available in the library. They are
categorized roughly by what type of data they operate on.
<p>

<ul> 
   <li> Mesh topology based (mesh entities are vertices, edges, faces, or 
        elements):
      <ul>
         <li> Get mesh entity children (e.g., get vertices that make up an
              element). </li>
	 <li> Get mesh entity parents (e.g., get elements that contain a 
              vertex). </li>
         <li> Get mesh entity neighbors. </li>
         <li> Skin (e.g., get the entities that make up the outer layer 
              of a set of mesh entities). </li> 
         <li> Segment (separate a set of mesh entities into separate connected
              components). </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Mesh coordinates based:
      <ul>
	 <li> Edge lengths, surface area, and region volumes. </li>
	 <li> Bounding boxes. </li>
	 <li> Centroid, variable-weighted centroid. </li>
	 <li> Get mesh entities within a box or sphere. </li>
	 <li> Kernel smooth variable. </li>
      </ul>
   </li>   
   <li> Variable based:
      <ul>
         <li> Variable math (e.g., add two variables to get a third).</li>
         <li> Threshold (e.g. get set of entities that pass threshold 
              criteria). </li>
         <li> Statistics (min, max, mean, standard deviation) </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Time based:
      <ul>
         <li> Feature tracking </li>
         <li> Entity variable history </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
